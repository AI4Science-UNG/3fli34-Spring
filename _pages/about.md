This is the course webpage for the course ["Selected Topics in Machine Learning and AI Applications in Science"](https://ung.si/en/schools/graduate-school/programmes/3FI/2025/3Fli34/2025/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. 


<p></p>

<p></p>

The course is a part of the [Doctoral Study Program in Physics](https://ung.si/en/schools/graduate-school/programmes/3FI/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at UNG. Completing this course will provide 6 ECTS requiring ~180 total hours of involvement (lectures + tutorial/discussion + individual work) from the interested graduate students. However the course is currently open to the UNG employees at all level to attend. 

<p></p> 

We are also planning to offer micro-credits for the course. More information to follow!

<p></p>

Please check [Schedule](https://ai4science-ung.github.io/3fli34-Spring/schedule/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to know beforehand the agenda + pre-requisites for the lecture. 

<p></p>


Basic knowledge of probability distributions and statistical analysis methods (likelihood, chi-square minimization, ..) would be really helpful from the beginning. The codes, and machine learning libraires used in the course are all based on python. So basic skills in python (arrays, lists, dictionaries, functions, ..) are necessary from the start of the course. Mode of communication throughout will be in English. You will find more helpful links to read/watch in [Resources](https://ai4science-ung.github.io/3fli34-Spring/resources/) page.

<p></p>

Course P.I. is [Prof. dr. Gabrijela Zaharijaš](https://www2.ung.si/~gzaharijas/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and lectures + tutorials will mostly be provided by the UNG [SMASH](https://smash.ung.si/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} fellows.

### Broad Overview of Topics: (Tentative)

 * Regression and Classification
 * Perceptron, Gradient Descent and Backpropagation
 * Deep Neural Network: Convolution and Convolutional Neural Network; Applications on Image Analysis
 * Handling and Preparing Data + Unsupervised Learning

<p></p>

<p></p>


### Software and Libraries:

As mentioned before, we will use Python ecosystem. Most common libraries that will be used in lectures+tutorials are: 

* Data Handling + Manipulation:
	* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Scipy](https://scipy.org/), [Numpy] (https://numpy.org/)

* Standard ML library: 
	* [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) 

* DL Libraries: 
	* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). 


_Other specific software stack/libraries for tutorials will be introduced by the instructor(s) during hands-on sessions._
