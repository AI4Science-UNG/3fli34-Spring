This is the course webpage for the course ["Selected Topics in Machine Learning and AI Applications in Science"](https://ung.si/en/schools/graduate-school/programmes/3FI/2025/3Fli34/2025/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. 


<p></p>

The course is a part of the [Doctoral Study Program in Physics](https://ung.si/en/schools/graduate-school/programmes/3FI/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at UNG. Completing this course will provide 6 ECTS requiring ~180 total hours of involvement (lectures + tutorial/discussion + individual work) from the interested graduate students. However the course is currently open to the UNG employees at all level to attend. Please check [Schedule](https://ai4science-ung.github.io/3fli34-Spring/schedule/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to know beforehand the agenda + pre-requisites for the lecture. 

Basic python skills are necessary from the start of the course and mode of communication throughout will be in English.  

<p></p>

Course P.I. is [Prof. dr. Gabrijela Zaharijaš](https://www2.ung.si/~gzaharijas/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and lectures + tutorials will mostly be provided by the UNG [SMASH](https://smash.ung.si/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} fellows.
